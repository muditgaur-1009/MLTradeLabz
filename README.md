🚀 Welcome to MLTradeLabz, an exciting repository dedicated to stock market prediction using cutting-edge machine learning approaches. Our repository hosts two remarkable projects: Time-Series Stock Market and TradeRL. 📈💻

## Time-Series Stock Market

The Time-Series Stock Market project is fueled by data from one of the largest stock market datasets available on Kaggle. Prepare to embark on a journey of exploration and prediction with this extensive dataset, which can be accessed here: [Stock Market Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs). 📊🔍

Our mission in this project is to leverage advanced time-series analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to unlock the secrets of the stock market. By harnessing the power of data-driven insights, we aim to equip investors with accurate predictions and valuable decision-making tools. 🕵️‍♀️💡💰

## TradeRL

Behold TradeRL, our state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning project tailored for stock market trading. Using the AlphaVantage API, we gather weekly market data, while the mighty `gym_anydaytrading` and `stable_baseline3` libraries serve as our trusty companions on this exciting journey. 🤖📈📉

TradeRL embodies the art of autonomous trading, driven by intelligent Reinforcement Learning agents. These agents master the complexities of the stock market, continuously adapting their strategies to maximize returns. Brace yourself for an awe-inspiring exploration of the market, where machine and finance converge. 💪💼💥
